# Delta Exchange API Setup Guide for Personal Trades

## 🎯 **Goal: Fetch Your Personal Trading History**

This guide will help you generate the correct API keys and fetch all your trades from Delta Exchange.

## 🔑 **Step 1: Generate New API Keys**

### **Why Generate New Keys?**
- Your current keys might be expired, invalid, or have insufficient permissions
- API keys can become inactive if not used regularly
- New keys ensure proper permissions for trade history access

### **How to Generate API Keys:**

1. **Login to Delta Exchange**
   - Go to: https://www.delta.exchange/
   - Login with your trading account

2. **Navigate to API Settings**
   - Click on your **profile icon** (top right)
   - Select **"API Keys"** from dropdown menu
   - Or go directly to: https://www.delta.exchange/app/account/api

3. **Create New API Key**
   - Click **"Create API Key"** button
   - Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "MindTrade AI Trading Journal")
   
4. **Set Permissions (CRITICAL)**
   - ✅ **Enable "Read Data"** permission (REQUIRED)
   - ✅ **Enable "Read Orders"** permission (for order history)
   - ✅ **Enable "Read Trade History"** permission (for fills)
   - ❌ **Disable "Trade"** permission (for security)
   
5. **Security Verification**
   - Complete 2FA verification if prompted
   - Solve any security challenges

6. **Copy Keys Immediately**
   - **API Key**: Copy and save immediately
   - **API Secret**: Copy and save immediately (shown only once!)
   - Store them in a secure location

## 📝 **Step 2: Update Your .env File**

Replace the placeholder values in your `.env` file:

```env
# Replace these with your NEW API keys from Delta Exchange
DELTA_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_from_step_1
DELTA_API_SECRET=your_actual_api_secret_from_step_1

# Keep your other credentials
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
```

**⚠️ Important:**
- Remove any spaces before/after the keys
- Don't include quotes around the keys
- Make sure there are no `your-` prefixes

## 🚀 **Step 3: Run the Personal Trades Fetcher**

```bash
# Activate your virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate

# Run the personal trades fetcher
python fetch_personal_trades.py
```

## 📊 **What the Script Will Fetch**

### **Your Personal Trading Data:**
1. **Trade Fills** - All executed trades with prices, volumes, fees
2. **Order History** - Your order placement and execution details  
3. **Position History** - Current and past positions
4. **Trading Statistics** - Volume, fees, symbols traded

### **Sample Output:**

   Total Fills: 47
   Buy Orders: 24
   Sell Orders: 23
   Total Volume: $12,450.67

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Issue 1: "invalid_api_key" Error**
**Solutions:**
- Generate completely new API keys (delete old ones first)
- Ensure "Read Data" permission is enabled
- Check if account is fully verified (KYC complete)
- Verify you're using production keys (not testnet)

### **Issue 2: "Authentication Failed"**
**Solutions:**
- Synchronize your system clock: `w32tm /resync` (Windows)
- Ensure no extra spaces in API keys
- Regenerate API keys with proper permissions

### **Issue 3: "No Data Found"**
**Solutions:**
- Extend date range (try 90 days instead of 30)
- Check if you have any trading activity
- Verify API permissions include trade history access

### **Issue 4: "Permission Denied"**
**Solutions:**
- Enable "Read Orders" and "Read Trade History" permissions
- Complete account verification if required
- Contact Delta Exchange support if permissions don't work

## 📱 **API Key Permissions Checklist**

When creating API keys, ensure these permissions are enabled:

- ✅ **Read Data** - Access account information
- ✅ **Read Orders** - Access order history  
- ✅ **Read Trade History** - Access trade fills
- ✅ **Read Positions** - Access position data
