        "An inconsistency in the provided data (total trades 155, but only 20 winning and 42 losing trades explicitly mentioned for average PnL calculations) suggests a potential lack of comprehensive tracking or understanding of all trade outcomes, possibly obscuring the true frequency and impact of small losses/breakeven trades."

        "**Overtrading (Probable):** The relatively high number of trades (155) combined with consistent losses often indicates an attempt to 'make up' for previous losses or a fear of missing out (FOMO) on market movements, rather than focusing on quality setups.",

Ensure every trade adheres strictly to this plan.",
        "**Drastically Reduce Trade Frequency and Prioritize Quality:** Instead of chasing opportunities, the trader must cultivate patience and wait for only the highest-probability setups that align with their refined long strategy. This will combat impulsivity and FOMO.",
        "**Implement Robust Risk Management Principles:** Beyond stop-losses, ensure that for every potential trade, the projected reward-to-risk ratio is significantly higher (e.g., 1:3 or more), especially given the current low win rate. This might require re-evaluating entry/exit points to improve the average win/loss ratio.",
        "**Maintain a Comprehensive Trading Journal:** For every trade, record not only the technical details (entry, exit, PnL) but also the rationale, the market conditions, and crucially, the emotional state and adherence to the trading plan.
